            Writing the Essay (Section 27)<br />
            3 April, 2024
          </p>

          <p>
            Ignorance is bliss. My white friend used this phrase in her English
            poetry and literature essay. Her school assignment, a few pages long
            and filled with quotes from mid-19th century English to contemporary
            American poetry—all written by white men—cast a shadow over my head
            as I tried to ignore the whiteness I saw as I proofread her paper.
            She then asked why I had mentioned this limitation of her essay
            topic, comparing past and present literature. As I reread her essay,
            I felt like I was opening a window into an empty page, a blank white
            canvas without any substance or color.
          </p>

          <p>
            The same whiteness I felt reading this essay is what Cathy Hong
            references in her piece “The End of White Innocence,” a personal
            reflection and essay on her childhood experience growing up in
            America. As an Asian American, she reflects on how whiteness has
            impacted her life through detailed and personal storytelling of
            multiple childhood and adulthood experiences that have shaped her
            perspective on racism in American society. In one instance, Hong
            visits an art installation by artist Carmen Winant depicting the
            experience of giving birth, in which she precipitates that although
            multiple art critics exclaimed and praised the installation for its
            profound imagery and meaning, she was unable to see past the
            whiteness on the wall– the absence of women of color giving birth.
            Hong writes, “When I look at the photos individually, I’m moved by
            the mothers’ exhaustion and joy, but when I step back, I can’t unsee
            the wall of whiteness…In Winant’s obsessive efforts to evoke the
            ‘all,’ I feel walled off” (Hong 16). She perceives this whiteness to
            have stained her life with the constant reminder of the white
            privilege and white innocence that continue to separate or “wall
            off” power, privilege, and representation to people of color in
            American society.
          </p>

          <p>
            In her essay, Hong illustrates the impact of “white innocence” as
            the effect of the systemic racism in America that has existed for
            centuries and continues to persist today. She posits that innocence
            is “both a privilege and a cognitive handicap, a sheltered
            unknowingness that, once protracted into adulthood, hardens into
            entitlement” (Hong 8). In the same way the phrase “Ignorance is
            bliss” can be used to describe the naivety of a child visiting
            Disneyland without understanding the expense involved, white
            innocence is the ignorance of white people in recognizing and
            acknowledging their role in racial inequality and systemic racism in
            America.
          </p>

          <p>
            Citing the widely known story of Adam and Eve, Hong posits that the
            “flip side” of an individual’s white innocence is the shame that
            minorities endure because of white innocence. She creates colorful
            imagery of how shame has eaten up her life: “It’s not about losing
            face. Shame squats over my face and sits” (Hong 8). Hong continues
            this bold personification by recalling an informal piece of evidence
            pointing back to her childhood, evoking an instance when she had
            worn a Playboy t-shirt to school. Here, her writing style is direct
            and informal, and there is an inexplicable change in tone compared
            to the empirical claims she makes earlier. Hong describes the
            feeling of shame as a “simmering somatic reaction” (9) on account of
            feeling disconnected and separated from her white counterparts at
            school. In the intersection of childhood and the feelings of shame,
            she recognizes the comedy of the stories she mentions, citing French
            philosopher Jean-Paul Satre’s philosophical work Being and
            Nothingness as being able to see her naivety “as the Other sees me”
            (10). In essence, her misfortune at school speaks more than just a
            child’s perception of themself– her story transcends a persistent
            feeling of shame that a majority of minorities consistently
            experience in American society.
          </p>

          <p>
            In an informal tone, Hong mentions three specific experiences that
            significantly influenced her childhood and adulthood as an Asian
            American. She says that rather than looking back at her childhood,
            she looked at childhood “sideways” (Hong 2), presenting her
            perspective of the shame she feels that has shaped her due to her
            being both the “afflicter” and the “afflicted” by racism (8). She
            brings up an account of her experience on the subway with her white
            friend, in which she engages in a heated standoff with a white man
            who uses a racial expletive at her; afterwards, her friend exclaims,
            “That’s never happened to me before” (14), implying that her
            emotional reaction to the incident is a direct result of the white
            innocence in the country. It's not just the racist encounter itself
            that Hong feels ashamed to have to encounter; it's also the
            realization of her friend's white innocence, the privilege of not
            having to experience racism—a privilege Hong does not have.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hong continues her essay by reinforcing her argument that white
            innocence has affected her life in many ways, adding crumbs of her
            first-hand experience with racism in various points of her essay.
            She posits that the shame she feels is reminiscent of the shame— the
            “oily flame” (Hong 17)— all Asian Americans have felt to varying
            degrees. However, what can be said about how other minorities feel
            when they experience racism in America? How can we combat racism in
            the country if the discrimination experienced by minority groups is
            so different? With this in consideration, exactly how can racism be
            tackled if it has taken shape and is rooted in so many different
            ways? Although Hong presents a compelling argument for the racism
            experienced by minorities in America, she fails to realize how
            different racism, particularly the effect of white innocence, can be
            for various minorities.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a person of color growing up in Western society, I ask the
            question, “How has white innocence affected my life?” This question
            prompted me to look back at past academic writings in which I
            explored my identity further, one of which was my college admissions
            essay. In this short 800-word essay, I attempt to capture myself as
            the perfect candidate for universities, as if I were pitching myself
            as a brand on Shark Tank. I remember the struggles of fabricating a
            compelling work that might convince the admissions officers reading
            my essay to understand my Asian identity, experiences, and
            perspectives. My inability to create a “perfect” essay, alongside
            numerous retakings of standardized tests, resulted from a
            self-inflicted expectancy to defy the ‘standards’ of the typical
            American college applicant.
          </p>

          <p>
            Expectations and standards have supported one of the crucial
            principles of racism to exist in the first place – stereotypes.
            Stereotypes, particularly those aimed at marginalized communities,
            govern American society– like counselors guiding students on what
            colleges to apply to– and define your status on the socioeconomic
            ladder, acting as bridges for people to understand your identity.
            Moreover, racial stereotypes exacerbate the perception of
            minorities’ identities and diminish their social status as another
            opportunity for racism and discrimination to occur in America.
          </p>

          <p>
            The college admissions process has been shaped by years of what one
            can call an embarrassing example of how America has failed to
            diversify its academia, a groundbreaking attempt to challenge
            systemic discrimination and, in particular, racist stereotypes. In
            her essay “The ‘Whitening’ of Asian Americans,” Iris Kuo highlights
            the role of college admissions in categorizing Asians with white
            people, perpetuating the model minority myth, and obscuring the
            realities of racial discrimination and prejudice that Asian
            Americans face. She argues that because of the misguided and often
            poorly executed efforts to combat discrimination and racism, Asian
            American experiences are frequently overlooked. Instead, they are
            seen as a minority that has reached the same status and privilege as
            white people.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kuo articulates that the grouping of white people with Asian
            Americans is an example of the process of expanding the “white race”
            to include more ethnic groups– what sociologists call “whitening”
            (Kuo 2). Kuo claims that although she feels she has gained many
            white privileges that other Asian individuals and minorities have
            not received, she still thinks that it is “disconcerting to be put
            in a separate category from other people of color” (4). That is to
            say, Kuo feels that Asian experiences should not be compared to the
            experiences of white people, as if the comparison were an attempt to
            diminish the racism that Asian Americans experience in society. Hong
            articulates a similar idea that some believe Asians “have it good,”
            as if racial trauma and experiences of discrimination were part of a
            “competitive sport” (Hong 10). If an Asian person had the same
            social status and privilege as a white person, what can be said
            about their difference in identity to that of other minorities? How
            about those in their community but without those privileges?
          </p>

          <p>
            Hong tells a story about a five-year-old Iranian boy who, in 2017,
            was handcuffed and detained “at Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C,
            for five hours because he was ‘identified as a possible threat’”
            (Hong 17). She brings up this story only to later suggest that the
            experiences that minorities face are all too similar and that they
            share the notion that America has exploited the home countries of
            minorities in the country in different ways for the goal of
            maintaining white supremacy. In other words, she argues that
            prejudice and discrimination exist for all minorities in various
            shapes and forms regardless of identity, such as the commonly held
            stereotypes Kuo mentions in her essay about the “model math student”
            and the “immigration menace” (Kuo 3).
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, what can be said about the experiences of other minorities
            living in America? Although Hong speaks on the overall presence of
            whiteness in America and its impact on minorities, attempting to
            reach minorities in general through the inclusion of some reference
            to other marginalized communities, she is primarily focused on the
            Asian American experience of whiteness, as her experiences are based
            on her own identity and not that of others. Because our encounters
            with racism and whiteness vastly differ, our emotions and responses
            to racism greatly vary from person to person. With that being said,
            how do the feelings of minorities become overlooked in the battle
            against racism?
          </p>

          <p>
            A perpetuated belief that persists among white people is the
            misconception that minorities' lives are persistently guided or
            reinforced by grief and loss as a result of the violence in America.
            Our feelings are seen as spectacles or the ‘end result’ of the
            racism that envelops itself in the daily lives of American citizens
            as if our identities were associated with an inhumane or
            criminal-like demeanor. Claudia Rankine articulates this sentiment
            in her essay “The Condition of Black Life Is One of Mourning,” a
            testament to the idea that minority communities– like the Black
            community she iterates in her article– are more complex in their
            multifaceted social and cultural dynamics than they are perceived to
            be in the media. She posits that “the associations of blackness with
            inarticulate, bestial criminality persist beneath the appearance of
            white civility” (Rankine 6), arguing that the assumption that
            minorities are lesser human or more immoral than the white
            population affects our social perception, experiences, and
            interactions with marginalized individuals. Rankine wrestles with
            the idea that the Black Lives Matter movement is “an attempt to keep
            mourning an open dynamic” (7) and “encourage[s] the white liberal to
            stop being a liberal and become an American radical” (7), a person
            with the ability to recognize the complexity of minority communities
            and the power that perception has to diminish their value as being
            less human. Rankine argues that white people need also be in a state
            of grief for what is happening in minority groups like the Black
            community– akin to Hong’s idea of losing one’s innocence and gaining
            the ”white double-consciousness” (Hong 18). Rankine quotes from
            scholar Linda Martín Alcoff, writing, “A sustained state of national
            mourning for black lives is called for in order to point to the
            undeniability of their devaluation” (Rankine 8), emphasizing the
            need for mourning by all American citizens, particularly white
            people, to forego racist perception and realize what has happened to
            their fellow Black citizens.
          </p>

          <p>
            While recalling the violent shooting of Michael Brown in 2017,
            Rankine iterates that minorities continue to be reminded that “black
            bodies don’t matter to law-enforcement officers” (Rankine 9) and, in
            a larger sense, society as a whole. Hong’s account of her encounter
            with a racist white man with her white friend only further
            exemplifies this idea– that white individuals will take a person of
            color’s feelings and make a situation unrelated to them about
            themselves instead. Rankine asks us to consider the sharing of our
            feelings with other identities through her call for “national
            mourning” (8), creating bridges to our individual experiences and
            benefiting from intertwining them.
          </p>

          <p>
            It has been three years since I read my white friend’s essay, and
            although much in my own life has changed since then, the encounters
            I have with white people today are much the same as before. Just
            days ago, I witnessed a white man use the “chink” slur against an
            older Asian woman on the street, a vile act too reminiscent of that
            of Hong’s encounter with a white man on the subway. Even now, I see
            the “wall of whiteness” she mentions in corners of my life as if
            it’s been shelved away tightly from my sight. As I’m writing this, I
            still can’t bring myself to answer how white innocence has affected
            my life. Although I have only recently begun living in America, I
            continue to face myself looking out at a diverse and enriching
            Western world blanketed with whiteness, an exploration for a
            confrontation with the racial dynamics that dictate the parameters
            of visibility for people of color.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is the account of stories and experiences that Hong, Kuo, and
            Rankine recall that preface a need for the recognition of how racism
            affects minorities' lives, a nod to American society’s social
            structure and governing system that only continues to benefit the
            lives of white people and ignore people of color. We are constantly
            reminded of our inferiority, denied the same status, power, and
            privilege that white people hold, and the methods that white people
            use to weaponize our inferiority create even more division in our
            respective communities. Yet, individual minority experiences differ
            significantly, even between individuals of the same group, and no
            instance of racism is the same as another. Perhaps, through the
            persuasion towards white people for greater recognition of our
            differences and our complexities as the same type of species, they
            may understand a semblance of the unconscious racism that continues
            to persist in America.
